# Clustering-in-machine-learning

K-means clustering is one of the simplest and popular unsupervised machine learning algorithms.Typically, unsupervised algorithms make inferences from datasets using only input vectors without referring to known, or labelled, outcomes.

A cluster refers to a collection of data points aggregated together because of certain similarities.

You’ll define a target number k, which refers to the number of centroids you need in the dataset. A centroid is the imaginary or real location representing the center of the cluster.
In other words, the K-means algorithm identifies k number of centroids, and then allocates every data point to the nearest cluster, while keeping the centroids as small as possible.

The ‘means’ in the K-means refers to averaging of the data; that is, finding the centroid.
